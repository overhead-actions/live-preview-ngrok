# live-preview

This project aims to provide a public/live URL of the application under development using [ngrok](https://ngrok.com/).

The workflow can facilitate simple front-end verification tests to more complex tests including API and back-end services.

To use it, you must have the project [Dockerized](https://docs.docker.com/) and if you have more than one service, add a [docker-compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/) file with the communication rules between each service.

As a demo we created a simple [Dockerfile](./Dockerfile) with nginx with a [static html](./static/index.html) page.

To enable the publication of the live URL, the [ngrok](https://ngrok.com/) tool was used, which creates a tunnel between the containers running inside the GitHub runners. Therefore, it is necessary to [login](https://dashboard.ngrok.com/signup) to the ngrok website and generate an auth token for it's use, adding as secret into GitHub repository.
